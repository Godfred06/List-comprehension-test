# List-comprehension-test
This repo takes a string of words and splits them into individual words and adds them to a list.
Clear_punc function takes the list and for each word checks to see whether there are any unwanted characters and removes them.
The newly modified words and the words which needed no formatting are all added to a new list.
The longlength function takes the new list and for every word in the list checks to see whether the lenght of the word is greater than or equal to 4.
If the word is, it is added to a final list and that is the final list that is printed out.
